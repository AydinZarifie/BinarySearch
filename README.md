# BinarySearch

Searching is one of the most commonly performed tasks in the domain of Computer Science. Many algorithms and data structures exist to make searching more efficient.
In this article, we'll look at the idea behind Binary Search and how to implement it in JavaScript.
Binary Search is a very simple, intuitive, yet efficient searching algorithm. The only caveat is that it works only sorted arrays, so some preprocessing on our data in order to sort it might be necessary.
Binary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, that divides the array roughly in half every time it checks whether an element of the array is the one we're looking for.
